		<p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, <br>
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— <br>
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, <br>
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. <br>
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door— <br>
            Only this and nothing more.”</p>

            <p>    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; <br>
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
    Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow <br>
    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br>
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore— <br>
            Nameless here for evermore.</p>

            <p> And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain <br>
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; <br>
    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating <br>
    “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door— <br>
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;— <br>
            This it is and nothing more.”</p>

            <p> Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, <br> 
“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; <br>
    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, <br>
    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, <br>
That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;— <br>
            Darkness there and nothing more. </p>

            <p class="Para4"> Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, <br>
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; <br>
    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, <br>
    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?” <br>
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”— <br>
            Merely this and nothing more.</p>
